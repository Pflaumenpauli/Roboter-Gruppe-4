= Tiny *GitHub* HowTo


== Download
=== Cloning existing *GibHub* project to your computer
- create a directory on your computer, where you want to store your local copy
 of the project
- open a terminal (if not done yet)
- `cd` to your newly created project root directory
- type `git clone [url]` and insert the git repository url instead of 
 `[url]`
- If everything worked fine, *you now have your own local copy of the project!*

=== Downloading the most recent project state
- open a terminal and `cd` to the project root directory
- type `git pull`
- If everything worked fine, *you now have an up-to-date copy of the project!*
*Tip*:: Use `git pull` each time *before* you start working to avoid evil
 merge conflicts!

== Upload 
=== Checking the status of your local project copy
- open a terminal, `cd` to any project directory and then type `git status`
- -> many interesting status info of your project will be shown, such as the
 branch you're currently on, whether your local project contains the latest 
 changes uploaded to the project, and a list of files with changes that are not
 staged (which means waiting to be uploaded) yet

=== Uploading your changes or newly created documents
- open a terminal and type `git add [filelist]` and replace `[filelist]` by one
 or many paths to files you've changed or newly created and that you want to
 upload
*Tip*:: *Always* specify the files you want to stage, even if there are lots of
 them! `git status` will help you identify them. (Don't simply type `git add`
 without the filelist, because then all files that were changed or created are 
 being staged (including useless metadata files created by your IDE)!)
- -> these files are now staged, which means waiting to be uploaded
- if you think you've made enough changes to upload a new version of the project
 and staged all these changes, type `git commit`
- now a screen with a twinkling cursor and lots of text will appear
- type in a short message that describes the changes that you're about to upload
 (such as `Inserted "Hello World" button to user interface`)
- press *__Ctrl__*+*__X__* to finish message typing
- press *__Y__* to confirm this
- press *__Enter__* to confirm that you want to confirm
*Tip*:: For good *Git* style, please always write a useful commit message ;-)!
- -> now you've locally created a new project version, called __commit__
- to upload that commit, type `git push`
- If everything worked fine (and your computer tells something like `writing 
 objectsâ€¦`, *you've successfully uploaded your changes to the project!*
- If some conflicts occured while trying to upload, see the __Solving merge
 conflicts__ section

=== Solving merge conflicts
- to be filled with content

== Project structure
=== Creating and switching branches
- open a terminal and `cd` to any project directory
- to show all available branches, type `git branch`
- to switch to another branch, type `git checkout [branchname]`
*Tip*:: Before you can switch to another branch, all changes you made to the
 current branch need to be staged (`git add [filelist]`).
- to create a new branch, type `git branch [branchname]`
*Tip*:: For good *Git* style, always work inside a branch other than the so 
 called __master__ branch. Only move your work to the __master__ branch, if they
 are proved to be correct and ment to remain in the project till the end of
 time!
